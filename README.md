# jrPred: Predictive Analytics One Day
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jr-packages/jrPred.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jr-packages/jrPred)

#### Internal notes

This package setup is non-standard. The "real" vignettes live in `inst/`. Running `make` copies
the tex file to `vignettes`. This is because it takes too long to build the practicals.
